    <dl>
        <dt>Responsibilities of Shoppers</dt>
        <dd>
            <ol>
                <li>Purchase items accurately according to the list of items provided by Buyers. If there is a shortage of stock, Shoppers need to request a replacement from the user.</li>
                <li>Submit the items to Buyers within the specified time. If you exceed the time limit, the consumption will be reduced by 30%.</li>
                <li>The number of timeouts is positively correlated with the Shoppers' rating. A low rating may result in the platform banning the Shoppers' service for a period of time.</li>
            </ol>
        </dd>

        <dt>Responsibilities of Buyers</dt>
        <dd>
            <ol>
                <li>When Shoppers make a replacement request, if Buyers do not respond within two minutes, Shoppers will have the right to choose the replaced item themselves without the approval of Buyers.</li>
                <li>After the order is completed, payment needs to be submitted within half an hour. The number of overdue submission penalties is negatively correlated with the Buyers' rating. Too low a rating will result in a longer waiting time for Shoppers to accept Buyers' order.</li>
                <li>When making a request, the default tip is a percentage of the total price of the items that Shoppers bring back, rather than a percentage of the total price of the items proposed by Buyers.</li>
            </ol>
        </dd>

        <dt>Responsibilities for all Users</dt>
        <dd>
            <ol>
                <li>Payment must be made through the Campus Dash platform.</li>
                <li>The platform keeps the funds in escrow until the errand is completed.</li>
            </ol>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    The above items are the first draft of the formal contract. The contract in the App may be changed.
